# SQL Portfolio Project - Data Analysis on Multiple Datasets 

Hello and welcome to this repository that features a three part SQL project that dives into various metrics pulled from two different datasets. 
For parts 1 & 2, I'll be looking at a COVID 19 database presented by *Our World in Data* that reports COVID-19 related information from the start of the 
pandemic in 2020. Part 3 will focus on a Real Estate transaction dataset that details properties sold from 2013-2019. This project will use 
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SMSS) to perform the following functions: 

### Part 1 - Queries on COVID-19 Dataset

In this section, I upload the Xcel dataset into SMSS and perform numerous queries to investigate important relationships among the data that have 
critical implications. 

Sample Query Extractions: 
  - Total Cases vs Total Deaths
  - Countries with the highest infection rate compared to population
  - Countries with the highest death count per population
  - Total Population vs. Number of Vaccinations 
  

### Part 2 - Visualizing COVID-19 Data with Tableau 

This section looks at four distinct query results and translates the data into four unique data visualization schemas in Tableau. 

Tableau Visualization Categories: 
  - Gloabl Death Percentage 
  - Total Death Count Per Continent 
  - Percent Population Infected Per Country 
  - Percent Population Infected 
  
### Part 3 - Data Cleaning on Real Estate Transaction Dataset

In this section, I practice data cleaning on the Real Estate Transaction dataset.

Sample Data Cleaning Measures: 
  - Remove duplicates, irrelevant data, and unused coloumns
  - Reformat property addresses 
  - Convert date/time data types
